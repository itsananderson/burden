There's a lot to be said about kitchen sinks.

First off, they can be quite complex, which is surprising to some.

Coding a Kitchen Sink
---

If you've never thought about coding a kitchen sink, you should.
It can be a very rewarding experience.
In addition to getting to code one, you'll learn valuable life skills that you'll take with you.
You may learn, for example, how to deal with streams.

```javascript
var stream = getStream();

stream.on('data', function(data) {
    console.log(data.toString('utf8');
});
```

Yay!

That's about it for now.  
More to come.
